### Home

We can access it with the `$HOME` variable.
This is a space with small amount of memory. This is used for the small variables, like the shell environment variables. 

### Work

Work space and storage. It can be found in `$WORK`. We store the files needed for the `batch` utilisation : library, source code, data, etc. 

There is a space where we can share with everyone: **`ALL_CCFRWORK**`

### SCRATCH/JOBSCRATCH

Work space to be used by batch, accessible with `$SCRATCH`. The folder is refreshed every **30 days.** 

It is used for large files and should be then copy paste in the `$WORK` directory to be saved. 

The path **`ALL_CCFRSCRATCH`** is a shared directory between projects.``

### Store

Archiving space, accessible through `$STORE`. This is used to be stored for a long time, and to not accessed frequently. 

There is also a space shared for projects, accessible with **`$ALL_CCFRSTORE`** command**.**

### DSDIR

Path with the public datasets available, accessible with `$DSDIR`. 

`$HOME` and `$WORK` are saved regularly through snapshots. This is accessible on the different directories with the `ls .snapshots` command.
